# Weather Station Firmware
This repository contains the firmware for the [Solar Powered weather station](https://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Powered-WiFi-Weather-Station-V20/)
project by [Open Green Energy](https://www.instructables.com/member/Open%20Green%20Energy/). In its original form, it is based on the code written
by [3KUdelta](https://github.com/3KUdelta/Solar_WiFi_Weather_Station).

The code was restructured and partly rewritten to fulfill my own requirements.
