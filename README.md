# Weather Station Firmware
This repository contains the firmware for the [Solar Powered weather station](https://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Powered-WiFi-Weather-Station-V20/)
project by [Open Green Energy](https://www.instructables.com/member/Open%20Green%20Energy/). In its original form, it is based on the code written
by [3KUdelta](https://github.com/3KUdelta/Solar_WiFi_Weather_Station).

The code was restructured and partly rewritten to fulfill my own requirements.

## Development
The easiest way of using this project is the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) IDE. The project is fully configured with a project definition which can be used
to fetch all required libraries and build the firmware.
